They bring together the lunarpunks, the uncompromising builders, the visionaries, and the long-term thinkers. These are my people, our people, creating a future that remembers what matters.",

As the politics of our world sink deeper into fascism, creating counter infrastructures and technologies that preserve people's autonomy and the freedom to reveal information will be vital for the resistance.",

Every one of them has had a unique vibe with deep critical thinking on the nature of the industry, with a strong practical advocacy for privacy technologies. The cypherpunk ethos is returning to crypto and I think this is in no small part down to the hard work of @nicksvyaznoy, @PG_CDG and the rest of the @web3privacy team, who are all genuinely welcoming and wonderful people.

      "I've been developing, lurking and partying around crypto for 15 years now and remember clearly there were some people worth knowing and making friends. The blockchain hype has been terrible because it flooded the space with obnoxious situations and a load of sociopaths, while interest in the most popular value proposition never faded: privacy for everyone and lower liability when running collective infrastructure. It has been a fine ride all the way, I just missed the part where we were making new interesting friendships. Thanks to web3privacy it is now back, and for this I am very grateful to this genuine community and its ways to keep alive the heartbeat of the real crypto movement.",

      "Over the last two years, I mostly stepped away from crypto events, feeling disconnected from the nihilistic, short-term focus dominating much of the space. While I still believe in the tech's potential for net-positive use cases, the focus on hyper-speculation wasn't something I could get excited about. So, I focused on the work we do with Radicle and Drips, ignoring the rest.\n\nThen, almost a year ago, I found Web3PrivacyNow. They managed to amplify the cypherpunk voice within the cryptocurrency space, proving it’s not just alive but growing stronger. There is a thriving, principled community in crypto that it's worth contributing to. Today it's their 2nd birthday. Happy Birthday, Web3PrivacyNow! 🎉 Your mission is more important now than ever.",

The blockchain hype has been terrible because it flooded the space with obnoxious situations and a load of sociopaths, while interest in the most popular value proposition never faded: privacy for everyone and lower liability when running collective infrastructure. It has been a fine ride all the way, I just missed the part where we were making new interesting friendships. Thanks to web3privacy it is now back, and for this I am very grateful to this genuine community and its ways to keep alive the heartbeat of the real crypto movement.",

While I still believe in the tech's potential for net-positive use cases, the focus on hyper-speculation wasn't something I could get excited about. So, I focused on the work we do with Radicle and Drips, ignoring the rest.\n\nThen, almost a year ago, I found Web3PrivacyNow. They managed to amplify the cypherpunk voice within the cryptocurrency space, proving it’s not just alive but growing stronger. There is a thriving, principled community in crypto that it's worth contributing to. Today it's their 2nd birthday. Happy Birthday, Web3PrivacyNow! 🎉 Your mission is more important now than ever.",
